<h1>Welcome!</h1>
Hello! This is Unfnyst's collection of super-awesome bookmarklets! its still a work in progress, but... but what? i dont know. I sometimes use ChatGPT and a bit of my own code to make bookmarklets so.. yeah lol

<h1>What is a Bookmarklet?</h1>

A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs javascript. This part is a bit complicated, but URLs have a seperate protocol for javascript. Web browsers allow people to put these links in bookmarks.

<h1>How do you run it?</h1>

Copy and paste the javascript code into the bookmarks bar. It's that easy.
